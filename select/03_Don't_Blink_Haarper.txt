(Instrumental)

I'm takin' over your mind
Spendin' with incredible speed and time
I will not settle for less
Don't charm
I'm thinkin' that I'll change my mind on a dime
On the week you but sleep
With one eye open every day of the week
Week, I'm up in the attic
By, to cause havoc on the crib

Something is taking over me
I'm burnin' the four leaf clover, see
I don't believe in luck
I believe in brute force
Just to fuck about the buck
Can you fill this thing
In the metal strings
Slowly severing, so clean
Metal mercury in the drinks
Had to fill to the brim

Don't blink
Don't blink
Don't blink
Don't blink
Bitch, you'll miss everything
That these-es
Will leave you fucking speechless
No misery
I need this

Don't blink
Don't blink
Don't blink
Bitch, you'll miss everything
That these-es
Will leave you fucking speechless
No misery
I need this

(Instrumental)
