I'm takin' over your mind
Spendin' with incredible speed in time
I will not settle for less, don't charm
I'm thinkin' that I'll change my
Mind on a dime on the week you but sleep
With one eye open every day of the week
Week I'm up in the attic
Buy to cause havoc on the crib
Something is taking over me
I'm burning the four leaf clover, see
I don't believe in luck
I believe in brute force
Give a fuck about the buck
Can you fill this thing in the metal strings
Slowly severing so clean
Metal mercury in the drinks
Had to fill to the brim
Don't blink don't blink
Don't blink bitch you miss everything
That these seas will leave
You fucking speechless
No misery, I need this
Don't blink don't blink
Don't blink bitch you miss everything
That these seas will leave
You fucking speechless
No misery, I need this
